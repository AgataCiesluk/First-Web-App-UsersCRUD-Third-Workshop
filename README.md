# UsersCRUD-my first web app
To create my first Web App (UsersCRUD) I used: MySQL, Java (Servlets, MVC), JSP files.

# What is the purpose?
You will be able to manage users as an admin. For example, you will be able to:
- see the list of all users,
- show their details, 
- remove users,
- add users,
- update information about any user.

# How to start using this app?
To run this app you will need some Container (I used Tomcat) and the database with users (id, username, email, password). The main page is:
```
http://localhost:8080/user/list
```
On the main page ```/user/list``` you will see a list of all of the users. Click on one of the hyperlinks beside chosen user to show the detailed info, edit or delete this user. To add a new user you can click on button, placed in top-right corner.

<b>Enjoy using this app!</b>
